How memory is managed in Python?

Memory Management in Python
1. Automatic Memory Management:
Python automatically handles memory. You don't need to manage it manually.

2. Heap Memory:
Python stores all objects in a special area of memory called the heap.

3. Reference Counting:
Python tracks how many times an object is being used. When no one is using it anymore, Python removes it.

4. Garbage Collection:
Python automatically deletes unused objects using garbage collection to free memory.

5. Efficient Memory Allocation:
Python uses a method called pymalloc to handle small memory blocks efficiently.
