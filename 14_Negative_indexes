<!-- What are Negative Indexes in Python? -->
Negative indexes are used in Python to access elements of a sequence (like a string, list, or tuple) from the end rather than the beginning.
In negative indexing:

-1 refers to the last element

-2 refers to the second last element

and so on...

<!-- Why are Negative Indexes Used? -->
To access elements from the end of a sequence easily.

To avoid using the length of the sequence manually.

It makes the code simpler and more readable, especially when working with the last few elements of a sequence.
